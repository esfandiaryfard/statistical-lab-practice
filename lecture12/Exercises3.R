#Consider the titanic_train dataframe. Plot the average fare paid by passengers in each class. With a
#facet_wrap split the plot by Survival. The final result should be similar to the following
#Is there any difference in the average fare paid by passengers in the three classes? Is there a difference
#between passengers who survived and those who didnâ€™t?
